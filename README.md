# TALK PULSE - Frontend (reddit clone)

## This is a school project MERN stack assignment

## This project is hosted on two providers
Backend on Render (node express server)
Frontend on Render https://talkpulse.onrender.com/ - (images somehow flow over container)
Frontend on Vercel https://talkpulse-cme.vercel.app/ (images dont flow over container)

About the images its, even after my fix - it is wierd that one hosting provider makes the container flow over but not the other
